# Importing the libraries
# Support for large, multi-dimensional arrays along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions.
import numpy as np
# Plotting library for Python and its mathematical extension NumPy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# library for data manipulation and analysis. Offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series
import pandas as pd

# Importing the dataset
