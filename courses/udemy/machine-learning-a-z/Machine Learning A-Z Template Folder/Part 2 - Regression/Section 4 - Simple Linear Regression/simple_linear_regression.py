# Data Preprocessing

# Importing the libraries
# Support for large, multi-dimensional arrays along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions.
import numpy as np
# Plotting library for Python and its mathematical extension NumPy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# library for data manipulation and analysis. Offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series
import pandas as pd

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv("Salary_Data.csv")
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, 1].values

# Splitting the dataset into training set and test set
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 1/3, random_state = 0)

# Fitting Simple Linear Regression to the Training set
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
regressor = LinearRegression()
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting the Test set results
y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)
